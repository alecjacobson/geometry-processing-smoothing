<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this assignment we will explore how to smooth a data <em>signal</em> defined over a
curved surface. The data <em>signal</em> may be a scalar field defined on a static
surface: for example, noisy temperatures on the surface of an airplane.
Smoothing in this context can be understood as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction">data
denoising</a>:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/plane-smooth-data.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The <em>signal</em> could also be the geometric positions of the surface itself. In
this context, smoothing acts also affects the underlying geometry of the
domain. We can understand this operation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_fairng">surface
fairing</a>:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/plane-smooth-geometry.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

<h3 id="flow-basedformulation">Flow-based formulation</h3>

<p>In both cases, the underlying mathematics of both operations will be very
similar. If we think of the signal as undergoing a <em>flow</em> toward a smooth
solution over some phony notion of &#8220;time&#8221;, then the governing partial
differential equation we will start with sets the change in signal value <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
over time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)">proportional
to</a> the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator">Laplacian</a> of the signal <span class="math">\(∆u\)</span>
(for now, roughly the second derivative of the signal as we move <em>on</em> the
surface):</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\frac{∂ u}{∂ t} = λ ∆ u,
\]</span></p>

<p>where the scalar parameter <span class="math">\(λ\)</span> controls the rate of smoothing.</p>

<p>When the signal is the surface geometry, we call this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_flow">geometric
flow</a>.</p>

<p>There are various ways to motivate this choice of flow for
data-/geometry-smoothing. Let us consider one way that will introduce the
Laplacian as a form of local averaging.</p>

<p>Given a noisy signal <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, intuitively we can <em>smooth</em> <span class="math">\(f\)</span> by averaging every
value with its neighbors&#8217; values. In continuous math, we might write that the
smoothed value <span class="math">\(u(\x)\)</span> at any point on our surface <span class="math">\(\x ∈ \S\)</span> should be equal to
the average value of some small
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)">ball</a> of nearby points:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
u(\x) = \frac{1}{|B(\x))|} ∫_{B(\x)} f(\z) \;d\z,
\]</span></p>

<p>If the ball <span class="math">\(B(\x)\)</span> is small, then we will have to repeat this averaging many
times to see a global smoothing effect. Hence, we can write that the current
value <span class="math">\(u^t\)</span> <em>flows</em> toward smooth solution by small steps <span class="math">\(δt\)</span> in time:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
u^{t+δt}(\x) = \frac{1}{|B(\x))|} ∫_{B(\x)} u^t(\z) \;d\z.
\]</span></p>

<p>Subtracting the current value <span class="math">\(u^t(\x)\)</span> from both sides and introducing a
flow-speed parameter <span class="math">\(λ\)</span> we have a flow equation
describing the change in value as an integral of relative values:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\frac{∂ u}{∂ t} 
  = λ \frac{1}{|B(\x))|} ∫_{B(\x)} u(\z)-u(\x) \;d\z.
\]</span></p>

<p>For harmonic functions, <span class="math">\(∆u =0\)</span>, this integral becomes zero in the limit as the
radius of the ball shrinks to zero via satisfaction of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_function#The_mean_value_property">mean value
theorem</a>.
It follows for a non-harmonic <span class="math">\(∆u ≠ 0\)</span> this integral is equal to the Laplacian
of the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, so we have arrived at our flow equation:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\frac{∂ u}{∂ t} 
  = \lim_{|B(\x)| → 0}  λ \frac{1}{|B(\x))|} ∫_{B(\x)} u(\z)-u(\x) \;d\z 
  = λ ∆ u.
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="energy-basedformulation">Energy-based formulation</h3>

<p>Alternatively, we can think of a single smoothing operation as the solution to
an energy minimization problem. If <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is our noisy signal over the surface,
then we want to find a signal <span class="math">\(u\)</span> such that it simultaneously minimizes its
difference with <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and minimizes its variation over the surface:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
u^* 
  = \argmin_u E_(u) 
  = 
  \argmin_u ½∫_\S \underbrace{(f-u)²}_\text{data term} + 
  λ\underbrace{‖∇u‖²}_\text{smoothness term} \;dA,
\]</span></p>

<p>where again the scalar parameter <span class="math">\(λ\)</span> controls the rate of smoothing. This
energy-based formulation is equivalent to the flow-based formulation.
Minimizing these energies is identical to stepping forward one temporal unit in
the flow.</p>

<h4 id="calculusofvariations">Calculus of variations</h4>

<p>In the smooth setting, our energy <span class="math">\(E\)</span> is a function that measures scalar value
of a given function <em>u</em>, making it a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)">functional</a>. To
understand how to <em>minimize</em> a functional with respect to an unknown function,
we will need concepts from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of
variations</a>.</p>

<p>We are used to working with minimizing quadratic <em>functions</em> with respect to a
discrete set of variables, where the minimum is obtained when the gradient of
the energy with respect to the variables is zero.</p>

<p>In our case, the functional <span class="math">\(E(u)\)</span> is quadratic in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> (recall that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">gradient operator</a> <span class="math">\(∇\)</span> is a linear
operator). The function <span class="math">\(u\)</span> that minimizes <span class="math">\(E(u)\)</span> will be obtained when any
small change or <em>variation</em> in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> has no change on the energy values. To
create a small change in a function <span class="math">\(u\)</span> we will add another function <span class="math">\(v\)</span> times
a infinitesimal scalar <span class="math">\(ε\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(E(u)\)</span> is minimized for a function <span class="math">\(w\)</span> and we
are given another arbitrary function <span class="math">\(v\)</span>, then let us define a function new
function </p>

<p><span class="math">\[
Φ(ε) = E(w+εv) = ½∫_\S (f-w+εv)² + λ ‖∇w + ε∇v‖²  \;dA,
\]</span>
where we observe that <span class="math">\(Φ\)</span> is quadratic in <span class="math">\(ε\)</span>.</p>

<p>Since <span class="math">\(E(w)\)</span> is minimal then <span class="math">\(Φ\)</span> is minimized when <span class="math">\(ε\)</span> is zero, and if <span class="math">\(Φ\)</span> is
minimal at <span class="math">\(ε=0\)</span>, then the derivative of <span class="math">\(Φ\)</span> with respect <span class="math">\(ε\)</span> must be zero:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
0 & = \left.\frac{∂Φ}{∂ε} \right|_{ε = 0},\\
  & = \left.\frac{∂}{∂ε} ½∫_\S (f-w-εv)² + λ ‖∇w + ε∇v‖²\;dA, \right|_{ε = 0} \\
  & = \left.\frac{∂}{∂ε} ½∫_\S
    f^2 - 2wf - 2εfv +w²+2εvw +ε²v² + λ ‖∇w‖² + λ2ε∇v⋅∇w + λ ε²‖∇w‖² \;dA \right|_{ε = 0}\\
  & = \left.∫_\S -fv + vw +2εvw  + λ∇v⋅∇w + λ ε‖∇w‖² \;dA \right|_{ε = 0}\\
  & = ∫_\S v(w-f)  + λ∇v⋅∇w \;dA.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>

<p>The choice of &#8220;test&#8221; function <span class="math">\(v\)</span> was arbitrary, so this must hold for any
(reasonable) choice of <span class="math">\(v\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
0 = ∫_\S v(w-f)  + λ∇v⋅∇w \;dA \quad ∀ v.
\]</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to claim much about <span class="math">\(w\)</span> from this equation directly because
derivatives of <span class="math">\(v\)</span> are still involved. We can <em>move</em> a derivative from <span class="math">\(v\)</span> to a
<span class="math">\(w\)</span> by applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_identities">Green&#8217;s first
identity</a>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
0 = ∫_\S v(w-f)  - λv∆w \;dA \quad (+  \text{boundary term} )\quad ∀ v,
\]</span>
where we choose to <em>ignore</em> the boundary terms (for now) or equivalently we
agree to work on <em>closed</em> surfaces <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>.</p>

<p>Since this equality must hold of <em>any</em> <span class="math">\(v\)</span> let us consider functions that are
little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_function">&#8220;blips&#8221;</a> centered at any
arbitrary point <span class="math">\(\x ∈ \S\)</span>. A function <span class="math">\(v\)</span> that is one at <span class="math">\(\x\)</span> and quickly
decays to zero everywhere else. To satisfy the equation above at <span class="math">\(\x\)</span> with this
blip <span class="math">\(v\)</span> we must have that:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
w(\x)-f(\x) = λ∆w(\x).
\]</span>
The choice of <span class="math">\(\x\)</span> was arbitrary so this must hold <em>everywhere</em>.</p>

<p>Because we invoke <em>variations</em> to arrive at this equation, we call the
<em>energy-based</em> formulation a <em>variational formulation</em>.</p>

<h3 id="implicitsmoothingiteration">Implicit smoothing iteration</h3>

<p>Now we understand that the flow-based formulation and the variational
formulation lead to the same system, let us concretely write out the implicit
smoothing step. </p>

<p>Letting <span class="math">\(u^0 = f\)</span> we compute a new smoothed function <span class="math">\(u^{t+1}\)</span> given the
current solution <span class="math">\(u^t\)</span> by solving the <em>linear</em> system of equations:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
u^t(\x) = (\text{id}-λ∆)u^{t+1}(\x), \quad ∀ \x ∈ \S
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\text{id}\)</span> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function">identity
operator</a>. In the discrete
case, we will need discrete approximations of the <span class="math">\(\text{id}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(∆\)</span>
operators.</p>

<p>All of these techniques will produce the <em>same</em> sparse <em>Laplacian matrix</em> <span class="math">\(\L ∈ \R^{n×n}\)</span>
for a mesh with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> vertices. </p>

<h3 id="finiteelementderivationofthediscretelaplacian">Finite element derivation of the discrete Laplacian</h3>

<p>We want to approximate the Laplacian of a function <span class="math">\(∆u\)</span>. Let us consider <span class="math">\(u\)</span> to
be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">piecewise-linear</a>
represented by scalar values at each vertex, collected in <span class="math">\(\u ∈ \R^n\)</span>.</p>

<p>Any piecewise-linear function can be expressed as a sum of values at mesh
vertices times corresponding piecewise-linear basis functions (a.k.a hat
functions, <span class="math">\(φ_i\)</span>):</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
u(\x) &= ∑_{i=1}^n u_i φ_i(\x), \\
φ(\x) &= \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if $\x = \v_i$}, \\
  \frac{\text{Area($\x$,$\v_j$,$\v_k$)}}{\text{Area($\v_i$,$\v_j$,$\v_k$)}} 
    & \text{if $\x ∈ \text{triangle}(i,j,k)$}, \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>

<figure>
<img src="images/hat-function.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>By plugging this definition into our smoothness energy above, we have discrete
energy that is quadratic in the values at each mesh vertex:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
∫_\S  ‖∇u(\x)‖² \;dA  
&= ∫_\S  \left\|∇\left(∑_{i=1}^n u_i φ_i(\x)\right)\right\|^2 \;dA  \\
&= ∫_\S  \left(∑_{i=1}^n u_i ∇φ_i(\x)\right)⋅\left(∑_{i=1}^n u_i ∇φ_i(\x)\right)  \;dA  \\
&= ∫_\S ∑_{i=1}^n ∑_{j=1}^n ∇φ_i⋅∇φ_j u_i u_j \;dA \\
&= \u^\transpose \L \u, \quad \text{where } L_{ij} =  ∫_\S  ∇φ_i⋅∇φ_j \;dA.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>

<p>By defining <span class="math">\(φ_i\)</span> as piecewise-linear hat functions, the values in the system
matrix <span class="math">\(L_{ij}\)</span> are uniquely determined by the geometry of the underlying mesh.
These values are famously known as <em>cotangent weights</em>. &#8220;Cotangent&#8221;
because, as we will shortly see, of their trigonometric formulae and &#8220;weights&#8221;
because as a matrix <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> they define a weighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">graph
Laplacian</a> for the given mesh.
Graph Laplacians are employed often in geometry processing, and often in
discrete contexts ostensibly disconnected from FEM. The choice or manipulation
of Laplacian weights and subsequent use as a discrete Laplace operator has been
a point of controversy in geometry processing research (see &#8220;Discrete laplace
operators: no free lunch&#8221; [Wardetzky et al. 2007]).</p>

<p>We first notice that <span class="math">\(∇φ_i\)</span> are constant on each triangle, and only nonzero on
triangles incident on node <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. For such a triangle, <span class="math">\(T_α\)</span>, this <span class="math">\(∇φ_i\)</span> points
perpendicularly from the opposite edge <span class="math">\(e_i\)</span> with inverse magnitude equal to
the height <span class="math">\(h\)</span> of the triangle treating that opposite edge as base:
\begin{equation} |∇φ_i| = \frac{1}{h} = \frac{|\e_i|}{2A}, \end{equation}
where <span class="math">\(\e_i\)</span> is the edge <span class="math">\(e_i\)</span> as a vector and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the area of the triangle.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/hat-function-gradient.png" alt="Leftpoints perpendicular to opposite edges. Right" />
<figcaption>	<meta name="Left" content="the gradient $∇ φ_i$ of a hat function $φ_i$ is piecewise-constant and"/>
	<meta name="points perpendicular to opposite edges. Right" content="hat function gradients $∇ φ_i$
and $∇ φ_j$ of neighboring nodes meet at angle $θ = π -
α_{ij}$."/>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, consider two neighboring nodes <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span>, connected by some edge
<span class="math">\(\e_{ij}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(∇φ_i\)</span> points toward node <span class="math">\(i\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math">\(\e_i\)</span> and
likewise <span class="math">\(∇ φ_j\)</span> points toward node <span class="math">\(j\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math">\(\e_j\)</span>. Call the angle
formed between these two vectors <span class="math">\(θ\)</span>. So we may write:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j = \|∇ φ_i\| \|∇ φ_j\| \cos θ =
\frac{\|\e_j\|}{2A}\frac{\|\e_i\|}{2A} \cos θ. 
\]</span></p>

<p>Now notice that the angle between <span class="math">\(\e_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\e_j\)</span>, call it <span class="math">\(α_{ij}\)</span>,
is <span class="math">\(π - θ\)</span>, but more importantly that:
<span class="math">\[
\cos θ = - \cos \left(π - θ\right) = -\cos α_{ij}.
\]</span>
So, we can rewrite equation the cosine law equation above into:
<span class="math">\[
-\frac{\|\e_j\|}{2A}\frac{\|\e_i\|}{2A} \cos 
α_{ij}.
\]</span>
Now, apply the definition of sine for right triangles:
<span class="math">\[
\sin α_{ij} = \frac{h_j}{\|\e_i\|} = \frac{h_i}{\|\e_j\|},
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span> is the height of the triangle treating <span class="math">\(\e_i\)</span> as base, and
likewise for <span class="math">\(h_j\)</span>. Rewriting the equation above, replacing one of the edge norms,
e.g.\ <span class="math">\(\|\e_i\|\)</span>:
<span class="math">\[
-\frac{\|\e_j\|}{2A} \frac{\frac{h_j}{\sinα_{ij}}}{2A} \cos α_{ij}.
\]</span></p>

<p>Combine the cosine and sine terms:
<span class="math">\[
-\frac{\|\e_j\|}{2A} \frac{h_j}{2A} \cot α_{ij}.
\]</span></p>

<p>Finally, since <span class="math">\(\|\e_j\|h_j=2A\)</span>, our constant dot product of these
gradients in our triangle is:
<span class="math">\[
∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j = -\frac{\cot α_{ij}}{2A}.
\]</span></p>

<p>Similarly, inside the other triangle <span class="math">\(T_β\)</span> incident
on nodes <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> with angle <span class="math">\(β_{ij}\)</span> we have a constant dot
product:
<span class="math">\[
∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j = -\frac{\cot β_{ij}}{2B},
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is the area <span class="math">\(T_β\)</span>.</p>

<p>Recall that <span class="math">\(φ_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(φ_j\)</span> are only both nonzero inside these two
triangles, <span class="math">\(T_α\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T_β\)</span>. So, since these constants are inside an
integral over area we may write:
<span class="math">\[
\int\limits_\S ∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j \;dA = 
\left.A∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j \right|_{T_α} + \left.B∇ φ_i ⋅ ∇ φ_j \right|_{T_β}
=
-\frac{1}{2} \left( \cot α_{ij} + \cot β_{ij} \right).
\]</span></p>

<h2 id="massmatrix">Mass matrix</h2>

<p>Treated as an <em>operator</em> (i.e., when used multiplied against a vector <span class="math">\(\L\u\)</span>),
the Laplacian matrix <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> computes the local integral of the Laplacian of a
function <span class="math">\(u\)</span>. In the energy-based formulation of the smoothing problem this is
not an issue. If we used a similar FEM derivation for the <em>data term</em> we would
get another sparse matrix <span class="math">\(\M ∈ \R^{n × n}\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫_\S (u-f)² \;dA 
  = ∫_\S ∑_{i=1}^n ∑_{j=1}^n φ_i⋅φ_j (u_i-f_i) (u_j-f_j) \;dA =
  (\u-\f)^\transpose \M (\u-\f),
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(\M\)</span> as an operator computes the local integral of a function&#8217;s value
(i.e., <span class="math">\(\M\u\)</span>).</p>

<p>This matrix <span class="math">\(\M\)</span> is often <em>diagonalized</em> or <em>lumped</em> into a diagonal matrix,
even in the context of FEM. So often we will simply set:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
M_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
  ⅓ ∑_{t=1}^m \begin{cases}
  \text{Area}(t) & \text{if triangle $t$ contains vertex $i$} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  & \text{if $i=j$}\\
  0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]</span>
for a mesh with <span class="math">\(m\)</span> triangles.</p>

<p>If we start directly with the continuous smoothing iteration equation, then we
have a point-wise equality. To fit in our integrated Laplacian <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> we should
convert it to a point-wise quantity. From a units perspective, we need to
divide by the local area. This would result in a discrete smoothing iteration
equation:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\u^t = (\I - λ\M^{-1} \L)\u^{t+1},
\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\I ∈ \R^{n×n}\)</span> is the identity matrix. This equation is <em>correct</em> but
the resulting matrix <span class="math">\(\A := \I - λ\M^{-1} \L\)</span> is not symmetric and thus slower
to solve against.</p>

<p>Instead, we could take the healthier view of requiring our smoothing iteration
equation to hold in a locally integrated sense. In this case, we replace mass
matrices on either side:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\M \u^t = (\M - λ\L)\u^{t+1}.
\]</span></p>

<p>Now the system matrix <span class="math">\(\A := \M + λ\L\)</span> will be symmetric and we can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition">Cholesky factorization</a>
to solve with it.</p>

<h3 id="laplaceoperatorisintrinsic">Laplace Operator is Intrinsic</h3>

<p>The discrete Laplacian operator and its accompanying mass matrix are
<em>intrinsic</em> operators in the sense that they <em>only</em> depend on lengths. In
practical terms, this means we do not need to know <em>where</em> vertices are
actually positioned in space (i.e., <span class="math">\(\V\)</span>). Rather we only need to know the
relative distances between neighboring vertices (i.e., edge lengths). We do not
even need to know which dimension this mesh is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">living
in</a>.</p>

<p>This also means that applying a transformation to a shape that does not change
any lengths on the surface (e.g., bending a sheet of paper) will have no affect
on the Laplacian.</p>

<h3 id="datadenoising">Data denoising</h3>

<p>For the data denoising application, our geometry of the domain is not changing
only the scalar function living upon it. We can build our discrete Laplacian
<span class="math">\(\L\)</span> and mass matrix <span class="math">\(\M\)</span> and apply the above formula with a chosen <span class="math">\(λ\)</span>
parameter.</p>

<h3 id="geometricsmoothing">Geometric smoothing</h3>

<p>For geometric smoothing, the Laplacian operator (both <span class="math">\(∆\)</span> in the continuous
setting and <span class="math">\(\L,\M\)</span> in the discrete setting) depend on the geometry of the
surface <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>. So if the signal <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is replaced with the positions of points on
the surface (say, <span class="math">\(\V ∈ \R^{n×3}\)</span> in the discrete case), then the smoothing
iteration update rule is a <em>non-linear</em> function if we write it as:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\M^{t+1} \V^t = (\M^{t+1} - λ\L^{t+1})\V^{t+1}.
\]</span></p>

<p>However, if we assume that small changes in <span class="math">\(\V\)</span> have a negligible effect on
<span class="math">\(\L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\M\)</span> then we can discretize <em>explicitly</em> by computing <span class="math">\(\L\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\M\)</span>
<em>before</em> performing the update:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\M^{t} \V^t = (\M^{t} - λ\L^{t}) \V^{t+1}.
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="whydidmymeshdisappear">Why did my mesh disappear?</h3>

<p>Repeated application of geometric smoothing may cause the mesh to &#8220;disappear&#8221;.
Actually the updated vertex values are being set to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN">NaNs</a> due to degenerate numerics. We are
rebuilding the discrete Laplacian at every new iteration, regardless of the
&#8220;quality&#8221; of the mesh&#8217;s triangles. In particular, if a triangle tends to become
skinnier and skinnier during smoothing, what will happen to the cotangents of
its angles?</p>

<p>In &#8220;Can Mean-Curvature Flow Be Made Non-Singular?&#8221;, Kazhdan et al. derive a new
type of geometric flow that is stable (so long as the mesh at time <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> is
reasonable). Their change is remarkably simple: do not update <span class="math">\(\L\)</span>, only update
<span class="math">\(\M\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="learnanalternativederivationofcotangentlaplacian">Learn an alternative derivation of cotangent Laplacian</h3>

<p>The &#8220;cotangent Laplacian&#8221; by far the most important tool in geometry
processing. It comes up everywhere. It is important to understand where it
comes from and be able to derive it (in one way or another).</p>

<p>The background section above contains a FEM derivation of the discrete
&#8220;cotangnet Laplacian&#8221;. For this (unmarked) task, read and understand one of the
